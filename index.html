<li><p id="Titi3">Trustworthy, reliable, fun, exciting, fantastically managed nursery for our child. At Modesire nursery, they make it work for the little one and for the parents. They have a massive play area surrounding the building also a sensory room and a soft play area for the children. Through the day the children do many activities, for instance, my daughter made her own massive pink ball of playdough the other day she was so thrilled, also story time, 1 on 1 teaching the children the necessary for their age group, I could go on forever, but all in all 100 out of 10 the whole team put their all into Modesire nursery, it truly is like little family.</p></li>

<li><p id="titi4">This place is safe and secure and the staff are really friendly. They work hard at identifying what makes your child happy and really bring the best out of them. There is a good vibe amongst staff and children which count for a lot in my opinion as other settings do not have this feel. I would recommend going for a show around if you are looking to place your child in this nursery. Modesire nursery are going from strength to strength and can only get better. </p></li>

<li><p id="titi5">My little boy has attended this nursery since he was 1year old, he is now 4years old. He is growing into a lovely, kind, well mannered little boy, thanks to Modesire nursery. He attends full time and each day is different. He comes home with a different story to tell me, new words, learning in numbers, name, alphabets, activities and with full excitment. Modesire nursery is a friendly family atmosphere, the staff are approachable, even down to the owners of the nursery. My little was a shy, quiet boy when he started . The staff have brought his personality out specially in front of people and children. He's not afraid to speak up, be loud etc. I can say confidently that Modesire nursery has got him ready to start school in september. </p></li>
